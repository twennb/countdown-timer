# Countdown Timer
A simple program that counts down to 0 from a user defined number of seconds

## How to Run the App
1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3 recommended).  
2. Clone this repository or download the `countdown.py` file.  
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.  
4. Navigate to the project directory and run:

  **Windows:**
   ```sh
   python countdown.py
   ```
  **MacOS:**
   ```sh
   python3 countdown.py
   ```
  **Linux:**
   ```sh
   python3 countdown.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompts!

## Possible Improvements
* Better input validation for efficiency.
* Allow for input of HH:MM:SS instead of just seconds.
* Ask user if they want to run more timers rather than just exiting at end.
